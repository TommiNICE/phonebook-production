# MERN Stack Web Application

## Introduction

This is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The journey of developing this application began as part of the **Fullstack Open MOOC** exercises, where the primary focus was on building a robust backend. Initially, the application had a basic UI implemented using plain HTML. To enhance the user experience, I developed a more modern and visually appealing frontend using **Tailwind CSS**.

The application serves as a hands-on project to consolidate my understanding of full-stack development, from building a server capable of handling CRUD operations to designing a dynamic and responsive frontend interface.


## Backend

The backend is built using **Node.js** and **Express.js**. It serves as the backbone of the application, providing RESTful APIs for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data stored in a **MongoDB** database. Key features of the backend include:

- **Create**: Add new resources to the database.
- **Read**: Fetch data, with support for filtering and querying.
- **Update**: Modify existing resources based on unique identifiers.
- **Delete**: Remove data securely from the database.


## Frontend

The frontend of the application is built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**, providing a modern, clean, and responsive user interface. Key features of the frontend include:

- **Dynamic Data Fetching**: Seamless integration with the backend API for real-time updates.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the application looks great on devices of all sizes.
- **User-Centric Design**: Interactive and intuitive components designed with usability in mind.

Tailwind CSS enabled rapid development of the UI by providing utility-first styling and consistent design practices.


## Deployment

The application is designed to be deployed on a VPS with **Nginx** as a reverse proxy and **PM2** for process management.
